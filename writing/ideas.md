For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1: Graph Theory
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Use Graphy Theory to make a complex maze. We can randomly generate the Vertices(The nodes or vertices) and the Edges(The connections between the vertices). Then we can randomly locate a mazerunner, and make it run to the end of the maze.
We then can show the output of the maze and try to calculate the time for the mazerunner to reach the end.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
It is connected to computer science because we are using the idea of Graph Theory, which is both what we learned from the class and can be counted as part of the advanced python learning. Besides that, to find out how to do the output of program and to find out the time cost(efficiency) of running a program are both important topic in computer science field.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php
It seems like a recently updated guide for learning graph theory, we can start from here and we need more articles and references later when we get to the output part and the time cost calculation part.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The central thesis of the article is to help people better understand the graph theory and provided some code for people to try and learn.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article can be a great example for us to start this project, we definitely need to do more reaserch and to find a more prefessional paper about the graph theory. However, it can be a good start for us to reach our final goal which is to find out the efficiency of running a random generated input map by using graph theory.
