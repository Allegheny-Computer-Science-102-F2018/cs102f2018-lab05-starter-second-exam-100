For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1: Graph Theory
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

Use Graph Theory to make a complex maze. We can randomly generate the Vertices(The nodes or vertices) and the Edges(The connections between the vertices). Then we can randomly locate a maze-runner, and make it run to the end of the maze.
We then can show the output of the maze and try to calculate the time for the maze-runner to reach the end.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

It is connected to computer science because we are using the idea of Graph Theory, which is both what we learned from the class and can be counted as part of the advanced python learning. Besides that, to find out how to do the output of program and to find out the time cost(efficiency) of running a program are both important topic in computer science field.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

# Article link

It seems like a recently updated guide for learning graph theory, we can start from here and we need more articles and references later when we get to the output part and the time cost calculation part.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis of the article is to help people better understand the graph theory and provided some code for people to try and learn.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article can be a great example for us to start this project, we definitely need to do more research and to find a more professional paper about the graph theory. However, it can be a good start for us to reach our final goal which is to find out the efficiency of running a random generated input map by using graph theory.

### Idea 2: Golden Ratio
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

 The idea behind this project is to find an application in which the golden ratio could be utilized. WE know from in class studies that this ratio is found everywhere in nature, but is there a way to apply this number for further benefit in computer science. So the goal of the project is to utilize the golden ratio as a means of generating random numbers. We can then compare the results of this algorithm to those provided in various libraries or packages.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea will utilize ideas of algorithm analysis during the comparison portion. In terms of the number generator, if it proves to be more efficient, it could be utilized in many applications. Random number generation is used all over various aspects of computer science from seeds to cryptography and simulation. So if a more efficient generator could be created then it could create quite a few benefits.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

The abstract of the article contains the inspiration for the idea.

" Specifically, digits – even randomly or systematically chosen consecutive digits or consecutive blocks of digits – of golden ratio may be used as a source of uniformly distributed random numbers. Unlike any of the several quasi- and pseudo-random number generators using various methods, we need to use no method here; only we have to pick up the consecutive/nonconsecutive blocks of digits from the stored golden ratio
and hence it would be a fastest means of obtaining random numbers. "

This piece from the article shows just one of the many applications of this ratio throughout computer science. From this piece we can take a concept that is mentioned and attempt to derive a working project that could be widely utilized.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis in this article discusses the importance of the golden ratio, how it can be derived and how it can be utilized in various fields. (obviously including computer science)

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article will provide support by further explaining the above piece. Through this explanation we can take what we have learned from our courses and apply it in order to try and create an application based on the explanation. The article may also provide useful examples that could further help our efforts.
