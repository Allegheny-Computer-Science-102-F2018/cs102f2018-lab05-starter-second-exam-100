### Idea 1: Graph Theory - Lancaster Wu
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

Use Graph Theory to make a complex maze. We can randomly generate the Vertices(The nodes or vertices) and the Edges(The connections between the vertices). Then we can randomly locate a maze-runner, and make it run to the end of the maze.
We then can show the output of the maze and try to calculate the time for the maze-runner to reach the end.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

It is connected to computer science because we are using the idea of Graph Theory, which is both what we learned from the class and can be counted as part of the advanced python learning. Besides that, to find out how to do the output of program and to find out the time cost(efficiency) of running a program are both important topic in computer science field.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

# Article link
https://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php

It seems like a recently updated guide for learning graph theory, we can start from here and we need more articles and references later when we get to the output part and the time cost calculation part.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis of the article is to help people better understand the graph theory and provided some code for people to try and learn.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article can be a great example for us to start this project, we definitely need to do more research and to find a more professional paper about the graph theory. However, it can be a good start for us to reach our final goal which is to find out the efficiency of running a random generated input map by using graph theory.

### Idea 2: Golden Ratio - Jon Reibel
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

 The idea behind this project is to find an application in which the golden ratio could be utilized. WE know from in class studies that this ratio is found everywhere in nature, but is there a way to apply this number for further benefit in computer science. So the goal of the project is to utilize the golden ratio as a means of generating random numbers. We can then compare the results of this algorithm to those provided in various libraries or packages.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea will utilize ideas of algorithm analysis during the comparison portion. In terms of the number generator, if it proves to be more efficient, it could be utilized in many applications. Random number generation is used all over various aspects of computer science from seeds to cryptography and simulation. So if a more efficient generator could be created then it could create quite a few benefits.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

# Article link

The abstract of the article contains the inspiration for the idea.

" Specifically, digits – even randomly or systematically chosen consecutive digits or consecutive blocks of digits – of golden ratio may be used as a source of uniformly distributed random numbers. Unlike any of the several quasi- and pseudo-random number generators using various methods, we need to use no method here; only we have to pick up the consecutive/nonconsecutive blocks of digits from the stored golden ratio
and hence it would be a fastest means of obtaining random numbers. "

This piece from the article shows just one of the many applications of this ratio throughout computer science. From this piece we can take a concept that is mentioned and attempt to derive a working project that could be widely utilized.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis in this article discusses the importance of the golden ratio, how it can be derived and how it can be utilized in various fields. (obviously including computer science)

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article will provide support by further explaining the above piece. Through this explanation we can take what we have learned from our courses and apply it in order to try and create an application based on the explanation. The article may also provide useful examples that could further help our efforts.


### Idea 3: Bayesian Statistics - Devin Spitalny
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

The idea behind this project would be to use Bayesian statistics in a sports sense. Bayesian statistics is the probability of something occurring. For example I plan on using a Bayesian statistics to project whether one team will beat another team based on information and data that was given like wins/losses, key players, and home/away.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

Bayesian Statistics connects to computer science because you make a program in python that can predict a scenario based on the information you give in the code. You could utilize this in many ways like what marble you are most likely going to get, what team will win the game, whether it will rain or not and etc it all depends on the information you put on the code that will be the factor of what happens.  

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

# Article link
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cYHHAAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Bayesian+statistics+in+python&ots=zolqYVuzyo&sig=deI83lfjK9RvzeGZhunbxlWVK14#v=onepage&q&f=false

This is a short book/article describing and explaining the use of Bayesian Statistics in python. That is perfect because my whole topic is about using Bayesian statistics to predict outcomes to a sports events like a basketball game. This books/article defines the meaning of Bayesian Statistics and shows examples like the cookie problem which is what is the probability you would get a vanilla cookie from a cookie jar that holds 50 cookies and 5 different flavors that represent ten cookies each. So I believe this book/article is perfect because it shows and explains examples of Bayesian statistics in a python setting.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis of this book/article is describing that Bayesian statistics is a math theorem that could be used in python to figure out the probability of a situation depending on the information you provide it with just like using the cookie problem as example to find the probability of what flavored cookie you will get in a 50 cookie max jar.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article supports my idea of using the Bayesian statistics to pick what team wins a sporting event like a basketball game because it explains and shows examples in python of Bayesian statistics.

### Idea 4: Truth Tables & Boolean Logic - Devin Ho
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

This idea utilizes truth tables in order to authenticate whether or not a product is authentic or not. In today's world, there is an immense production of fake goods that are in the market. However, if there is a perfect program to identify its legitimacy, then people will feel more secure when purchasing a product in the resell market. Generally, a product's legitimacy is not a concern from a retail store like Nike.com. A piece of software could authenticate whether or not a product is real. Then, whoever is selling the product can then list their product on the software for a buyer to buy. Once a price is matched, the seller will send the product to the middle-man company who owns the software. The middle-man company will confirm that the product is real and then finally send it to the buyer. This is a similar concept to StockX, which is a website that already performs this idea. However, they do not share the means of how they authenticate the product, nor do they have a software that determines it.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

Through the use of a software, the code could apply truth tables and Boolean logic in order to authenticate the product. In a truth table, logical operators is ideal with dealing with the legitimacy of a product. Thus, this truth table can also act as a legitimacy guide for many sellers and buyers alike.


3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

An argument is INVALID if and only if it is logically possible for the conclusion to be false even though every premise is assumed to be true. Truth tables apply Boolean logic in order to determine whether or not something results in true or false.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article explains the concept of truth tables and how they are used in conjunction with Boolean logic. We can then apply this knowledge when developing a software that allows the user to determine the legitimacy of their product. The consumer can finally purchase something through a comfortable and safe platform.

### Idea 5:  Using Python in Other Scientific Disciplines. - Jon Reibel
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

Since we have learned about Python and its large capabilities, it would be interesting to see how it can be utilized in other areas. So, our goal for this project would be to find a high level science problem in some other discipline. From there apply what we have learned in order to try and generate a solution. We would then discuss our implementation and go in depth of why our Python program is able to give us a solution to this problem.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

The most obvious connection is using the Python programming language. We would also utilize the skills covered in class in order to successfully solve our intended application.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

# Article link

The abstract of the article again contains the inspiration for the idea.

" This paper examines the feasibility of high-level Python based utilities for numerically intensive
applications via an example of a multidimensional integration for the evaluation of the statistical
characteristics of a random variable. "

This piece from the article discusses how Python can be utilized for more math based applications. since most of the other branches of science deal heavily in math, it will gives us some ideas in order to apply Python to a more advanced application (Outside of computer science).

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central thesis of the article describes how high-level languages can be applied to other heavy numerical cases. Also how the models can be efficient tools for implementation and modification of models and formulas.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article will support our idea by giving us a little information on outside applications. This article focuses on more math based examples, which is fine as science is heavily math based. Using the topics covered in the article, we will then be able to try and apply the Python language to a problem in another scientific discipline. Hopefully, by doing so we will be able to generate a solution and be able to understand the efficiency of the language outside of computer science.
