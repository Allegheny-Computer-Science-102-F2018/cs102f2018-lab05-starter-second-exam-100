Idea: Maze Game Utilizing Graph Theory

# Feel free to make any changes and additions

For our project, We are going to further experiment with graph theory. Our plan is to randomly generate nodes and edges to create a maze. We will be able to create both complex and simple mazes in order to produce a wide range of data. After we generate the maze, we will randomly generate a maze-runner. The goal of this maze-runner is simply to make it to the end of the maze. Upon completion of the maze, we will collect and store the output. Utilizing this output, we will be able to calculate the time of completion and store the maze solution for further use.

The solutions to the maze can be further looked into in order to apply further problem solving. With the maze solutions, we can store them and utilize them in similar situations. Basically, we can try to use similar solutions to similar mazes to prevent the program from running through the maze very time. In turn our program will be more efficient as it cuts down the required run time.   


# Need to discuss implementation. OBC said to look into the pygames package for the maze portion
